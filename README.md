# TrainNotificatorProject
project to create a daily notification go go and return to the office and keep updated about the trains taht i should take

functions ideas:

- Abfahrts: monitor that will read the departures in the time that im going to take the train, a few minutes before the desired time, will call the API and send via telegram to the user the status of the station, particullary the train that i should take. Informing about posible delay and info about the platform.
- night checker : every night will check the plan of the next train that i should take in the morning, to go and come back to the office. informing about possible "dissappearing" of the train or change of plans
